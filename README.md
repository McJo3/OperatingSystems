- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room was a client that had an application called "Draw It or Lose It" that is an Android application only. They wanted to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on the current game. The application needed to be transformed from just Android compatible to being able to run on Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems as well.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I felt that I did particularly well at articulating the benefits of each operating system as well as highlighting the potential issues. It's important to be clear and concise when dealing with a client of any kind and I feel that I did fairly well at making my points directly without uneccesary babble. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I was a little sceptikal of the design document at first, however, I grew to appreciate it very much. When it came to developing the code, it was really pleasant to be able to see exactly where I was in the process, where I had left off, what needed done still, and worded explanations of the process in it's entirety.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  The evaluation part of this document could have been done in a better way I think. As I have become more and more confident and knowledgable about this topic, I feel that I could have made slightly better points with a little extra detail to make it clear what the advantages and disadvantages of each operating system are.

- How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

  The user's need in this scenario seemed pretty clear, a fast and easy to manuveur game application accessible on the web to a larger audience. To do this, the client needed the best option for a web-based server and operating system to run the application. Speed, efficiency, and security were the most important things I took away from the client's request and that is what I used to approach finding the best OS for them. If we do not consider the user's needs when designing, then it will prove difficult to deliver a great product that THEY like. Afterall, the client is the one paying for us to be doing the design. I would consider it poor business practice to not take the client's needs into consideration. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- How did you approach designging software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I tried to approach it from a blank slate and I would most certainly continue doing that in the future. Normally, I find it important to go into projects with an unbiased point of view. I could be very biased to using Mac for instance and have that be my "go to" when evaluating the proper OS to use. However, just because I like it and am comfortable with it, doesn't mean that it best suits the clients needs.
